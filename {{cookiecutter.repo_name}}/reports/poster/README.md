# Poster for conference presentation

Use image as template. Ideas from [Mike Morrison's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs&t=2s).

Notes: 
1) Title of the poster should be your main result of the poster.
	Aim should be to convey your main results in 5 secs while audience passes by your poster.

2) Use of casual languege in poster title reduces cognitive load.
	Casual languege creates sense of social presence which is better for learning.

3) Use of illustrtation with title text helps people elaborate things in their mind.
	A real image from study is best but if it's too complicated, use notional figures.

4) Use color, font and images to trigger an emotion that reinforces what you are trying to convey.

5) Surprise and delight: If possible add a delight factor to your poster. 
	For example, if it's neuronal learning study, add two neuron buddys getting bonded :D 

6) To reduce social pressure while presentor is standing next to the poster, have results & highlight section in the middle of the poster. The Methods and 1-2 line intro sidebar shoud be located far away from you (on left) for people to skim without interacting with you.

7) Heavily rely on figure demonstration. Audience should be able to finish poster in 30 secs with clear understanding.

8) Add authors and citation (maybe not FUNDING agency :D) at the end in the corner (like movies). Add QR code with pdf of poster, paper (if any) and contact info in QR code.
