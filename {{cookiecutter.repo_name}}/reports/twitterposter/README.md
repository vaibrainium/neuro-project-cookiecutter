# Tweeter version of report.

Use this as template. Ideas from [Mike Morrison's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQDL8r3r_d4).


1) Use 2:1 ratio so it fits on tweeter without cropping.
2) 3 slides with 5 secs transition time.
3) Main results on first slide. What is significance of this result on second slide. How you made that inference on 3rd slide (Methods).
4) Make GIF file
